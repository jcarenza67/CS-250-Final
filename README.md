# CS-250-Final

# Sprint Review and Retrospective

## Project Overview

This Sprint Review and Retrospective reflects the work completed for the development of the SNHU Travel project using Scrum-Agile methodologies. The focus of this project was to design software that meets user needs while ensuring consistent delivery through iterative development cycles. As part of this process, I explored how to incorporate Agile principles and best practices into my development work. 

## Essential Questions

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with understanding the problem the user is facing and the goals they want to achieve. This requires clear communication, often facilitated by direct interaction with users or stakeholders to gather specific requirements. In Agile development, this process is supported by creating *user stories*, which help break down user needs into manageable, actionable pieces. User stories typically follow a structure like, “As a [user type], I want [goal], so that [benefit].” This format ensures that each feature I implement is focused on solving a real user problem and is tied to a specific outcome, helping me prioritize development based on user impact.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs begins with careful planning and understanding the requirements, followed by iterative development cycles. I prefer to break down complex tasks into smaller components, making it easier to focus on delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) before expanding. The Agile processes I plan to incorporate in my future work include maintaining regular *sprint cycles*, *continuous integration*, and *feedback loops* through *sprint reviews* and *retrospectives*. These Agile practices ensure that I consistently deliver functional increments of software while allowing room for adjustments based on user feedback and evolving project requirements.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to the team's success by collaborating effectively, communicating openly, and supporting others. It also means being adaptable to change, willing to learn from feedback, and helping to solve problems collectively. In an Agile context, this involves attending daily standups, participating in sprint planning, and contributing to retrospectives. A good team member is not only focused on individual success but also on how their work impacts the team's overall goals and the project's outcome.
